## About me

I'm Alexis, a soon to be front end junior software developer.
Up until the date, I have been studying web development on my own for several months, unable to leave the tutorial hell I decided to take a step forward joining the front end development bootcamp by Ironhack, this project will be my first time in which I will finally use the knowledge I've acquired to create something rather than just copying the code. 


## Words can't describe how grateful I am - Special thanks
 RUB√âN ü´∂üèª FOR SPENDING A COUPLE OF MINUTES IN WHAT TOOK ME HALF OF AN HOUR TO CLOSE AN ANCHOR ELEMENT
